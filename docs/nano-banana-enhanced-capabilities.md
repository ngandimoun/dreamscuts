## üé≠ Comic Generation

Generate entire comic pages with consistent characters and backgrounds.

### Single Panel Generation
```
Create a comic panel in modern colorful comic art style. Character: A young woman with freckles, sitting on a bench outside texting with her phone, her red handbag is on the bench. Action: sitting on a bench outside texting with her phone. Background: calm and quiet park with trees. Dialogue: comic text effect near her phone showing 'tap'. Lighting: natural outdoor lighting.
```

### Next Panel Generation
```
Generate the next panel where a teenager grabs her handbag in a swift motion and tries to run away. Use same style, colors, and setting with suitable angle of view. Add dialogue: "Someone please help".
```

### Workflow
1. Generate first panel with character description and action
2. Copy the generated image and use it as reference for next panel
3. Continue with subsequent panels maintaining consistency
4. Combine all panels in a 2x2 grid using Canva or similar tool

## üìê Aspect Ratio Control

Control output aspect ratios through reference images.

### Technique
The aspect ratio of generated images matches the reference images used.

### Exact Prompt
```
Redraw the content from image one onto image two and adjust image one by adding content so that its aspect ratio matches image two at the same time. Completely remove the content of image 2, keeping only its aspect ratio. Make sure no blank areas are left.
```

### Workflow
1. Upload your main image first
2. Upload a blank image with your desired aspect ratio as the second image
3. Use the exact prompt template above
4. The output will match the aspect ratio of the second image

## üì∏ Professional Photography Techniques

### The 6-Component Formula
1. **Subject** - Specific and clear subject description
2. **Action** - What the subject is doing
3. **Environment** - Where the scene takes place
4. **Art Style** - Camera and quality specifications
5. **Lighting** - Lighting setup and conditions
6. **Details** - Additional details that make the image feel real

### Example
```
A young woman with freckles smiling thoughtfully and sitting on a beach in a cozy cafe by the window. Shot on a Canon 5D Mark IV. Natural window light. Warm coffee cup and hands, soft focus background.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { NanoBananaExecutor } from './executors/nano-banana';

const executor = new NanoBananaExecutor(apiKey);

// Identity transformation
const result = await executor.identityCharacterTransformation({
  subject_description: "A person in casual clothing",
  target_character: "astronaut",
  preserve_face: true,
  preserve_outfit: false,
  preserve_pose: false
}, referenceImage);

// Style application
const styledResult = await executor.styleEffectApplication({
  target_style: "Van Gogh",
  preserve_subject: true,
  intensity: "moderate"
}, referenceImage);

// Comic generation
const comicPanel = await executor.generateComicPanel(
  "A young woman with freckles, sitting on a bench outside texting with her phone",

  "calm and quiet park with trees",
  {
    artStyle: "modern colorful comic art style",
    aspectRatio: "1:1",
    dialogue: "comic text effect near her phone showing 'tap'"
  }
);
```
