```typescript
import { FalAiPixverseV5TextToVideoExecutor } from './executors/fal-ai-pixverse-v5-text-to-video';

const executor = new FalAiPixverseV5TextToVideoExecutor();

const input = {
  prompt: "A serene mountain landscape at sunset with golden light filtering through clouds",
  aspect_ratio: "16:9",
  resolution: "720p",
  duration: "5"
};

try {
  const result = await executor.generateVideo(input);
  console.log('Video generated:', result.video.url);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Generation failed:', error.message);
}
```

### Advanced Video Generation with Style

```typescript
const advancedInput = {
  prompt: "Epic low-cut camera capture of a girl clad in ultraviolet threads, Peter Max art style depiction, luminous diamond skin glistening under a vast moon's radiance, embodied in a superhuman flight among mystical ruins, symbolizing a deity's ritual ascent, hyper-detailed",
  aspect_ratio: "16:9",
  resolution: "720p",
  duration: "5",
  negative_prompt: "blurry, low quality, low resolution, pixelated, noisy, grainy, out of focus, poorly lit, poorly exposed, poorly composed, poorly framed, poorly cropped, poorly color corrected, poorly color graded",
  style: "cyberpunk"
};

const result = await executor.generateVideo(advancedInput);
```

### Queue-Based Processing

```typescript
// Submit to queue for long-running requests
const { request_id } = await executor.submitToQueue(input, "https://webhook.url/notify");

// Check status
const status = await FalAiPixverseV5TextToVideoExecutor.checkQueueStatus(request_id);

// Get result when complete
const result = await FalAiPixverseV5TextToVideoExecutor.getQueueResult(request_id);
```

### Cost Calculation

```typescript
// Calculate cost for different configurations
const cost720p5s = executor.calculateCost('720p', '5'); // $0.20 for 5 seconds at 720p
const cost720p8s = executor.calculateCost('720p', '8'); // $0.40 for 8 seconds at 720p
const cost1080p5s = executor.calculateCost('1080p', '5'); // $0.40 for 5 seconds at 1080p

// Get cost examples
const examples = executor.getCostExamples();
examples.forEach(example => {
  console.log(`${example.duration} at ${example.resolution}: $${example.cost}`);
});
```

## Best Practices

### Prompt Writing Strategy
