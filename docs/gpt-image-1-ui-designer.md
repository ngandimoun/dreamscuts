## Model Information

- **Model**: `gpt-image-1`
- **Provider**: OpenAI (Official API)
- **API**: Direct OpenAI SDK integration (not Fal.ai or Replicate)
- **Specialization**: UI/UX design, interface design, user experience
- **Pricing**: $5-40 per 1M tokens (varies by quality and size)
- **Processing Time**: 30 seconds to 2 minutes (complex interfaces)
- **API Key**: Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

## ⚠️ CRITICAL LIMITATION: Face Character Consistency

**GPT Image 1 has extremely poor face character consistency.** This is a fundamental limitation of the model that cannot be overcome with better prompts or techniques.

### What This Means:
- **NEVER use GPT Image 1 for UI designs that include faces or characters**
- **Faces will be distorted, changed, or completely replaced**
- **Character consistency is not maintained across edits**
- **This applies to ALL operations: generation, editing, and modification**

### Safe UI Use Cases:
- ✅ **Interface layouts** (buttons, forms, navigation, menus)
- ✅ **Data visualizations** (charts, graphs, dashboards)
- ✅ **Product interfaces** (e-commerce, admin panels, dashboards)
- ✅ **Text-heavy UIs** (forms, content layouts, typography)
- ✅ **Abstract UI elements** (icons, patterns, geometric designs)

### Avoid These UI Use Cases:
- ❌ **Avatar or profile picture areas** (user images, profile photos)
- ❌ **Team member sections** (staff photos, about pages with faces)
- ❌ **Testimonial sections** (customer photos, user reviews with faces)
- ❌ **Character-based UIs** (game interfaces with character avatars)
- ❌ **Social features** (user photos, friend lists with faces)

### Automatic Protection:
The system automatically detects and blocks requests that might contain face-related UI elements, providing clear error messages to prevent accidental usage.
