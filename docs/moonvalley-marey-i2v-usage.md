## Usage Examples

### Basic Image-to-Video Generation

```typescript
import { MoonvalleyMareyI2VExecutor } from './executors/moonvalley-marey-i2v';

const executor = new MoonvalleyMareyI2VExecutor();

const result = await executor.generateVideo({
  prompt: 'Detailed Description: In a hidden jungle grotto, a majestic waterfall plunges into a dark, serene pool below. Ethereal sunbeams slice through the dense canopy high above, illuminating the swirling mist generated by the powerful cascade. The light rays dance across the scene, highlighting the vibrant green foliage that clings to the dark, wet rock walls. The constant roar of the falling water echoes through the secluded space, as the surface of the pool ripples and churns from the impact, creating a mesmerizing display of nature\'s raw power and tranquil beauty. Background: Brilliant sunbeams pierce through an opening in the dense jungle canopy, their ethereal rays shifting and shimmering as they cut through the misty air. Middleground: A powerful column of white water cascades down a dark, foliage-covered cliff face, creating a stark contrast with the shadowy recesses of the grotto. Foreground: The waterfall crashes into a dark, churning pool of water, sending up a fine spray and creating ever-expanding ripples across the surface.',
  image_url: 'https://d1kaxrqq3vfrw5.cloudfront.net/fal-launch-assets/guide-assets/fal-i2v-example-input.png',
  dimensions: '1920x1080',
  duration: '5s',
  negative_prompt: '<synthetic> <scene cut> low-poly, flat shader, bad rigging, stiff animation, uncanny eyes, low-quality textures, looping glitch, cheap effect, overbloom, bloom spam, default lighting, game asset, stiff face, ugly specular, AI artifacts',
  seed: 9
});
```

### Queue-Based Processing for Longer Content

```typescript
// Submit to queue for longer videos
const { request_id } = await executor.submitToQueue({
  prompt: 'Cinematic wide shot of a majestic mountain range at golden hour. The camera slowly pans from left to right, revealing snow-capped peaks that glow with warm amber light. Rolling hills covered in dense evergreen forests stretch into the distance, their shadows lengthening as the sun sets. A pristine alpine lake reflects the sky\'s vibrant colors, creating a mirror-like surface. Atmospheric mist drifts through the valleys, adding depth and mystery to the scene. The lighting creates dramatic contrast between the illuminated peaks and shadowed valleys, emphasizing the rugged terrain\'s natural beauty.',
  image_url: 'https://example.com/mountains.jpg',
  dimensions: '1920x1080',
  duration: '10s',
  negative_prompt: 'low quality, blurry, distorted, artificial, synthetic',
  seed: -1
});

// Check status
const status = await MoonvalleyMareyI2VExecutor.checkQueueStatus(request_id);

// Get result when complete
if (status.status === 'completed') {
  const result = await MoonvalleyMareyI2VExecutor.getQueueResult(request_id);
}
```

### Cost Calculation

```typescript
// Calculate cost based on duration
const cost5s = executor.calculateCost('5s'); // $1.50
const cost10s = executor.calculateCost('10s'); // $3.00

// Get cost examples for different scenarios
const examples = executor.getCostExamples();
```

## Best Practices

### Prompt Writing

1. **Minimum Length**: Aim for at least 50 words of detail for best results
2. **Use Recommended Structure**: Follow the structure: [Camera Movement] + [Scale/Perspective] + [Core Visual] + [Environmental Details] + [Lighting/Technical Specs]
3. **Camera Details**: Be descriptive about camera work (e.g., 35mm, handheld shot, tracking shot)
4. **Scene Description**: Include environment, atmosphere, and setting details
5. **Subject Action**: Clearly describe subjects and their movements
6. **Technical Specs**: Mention lighting conditions and technical aspects
7. **Avoid Negatives**: Don't include negative prompts in the main description - use the negative_prompt field
8. **Focus on Motion**: Describe the movement and changes you want from the starting image

### Prompt Structure Example

```
[Camera Movement]: Cinematic tracking shot through a bustling city street
[Scale/Perspective]: Wide angle, street-level perspective
[Core Visual]: People walking with umbrellas, neon-lit storefronts
[Environmental Details]: Wet pavement, night atmosphere, urban setting
[Lighting/Technical Specs]: Neon lighting, streetlights, reflections on wet surfaces
[Motion Elements]: Dynamic movement and transitions from the starting image
```

### Image Preparation

1. **High Quality**: Use clear, high-resolution images for better starting frames
2. **Good Lighting**: Ensure proper contrast and visibility in source images
3. **Starting Point**: Choose images that represent your desired starting point
4. **Transition Consideration**: Consider how the image will transition to video
5. **Aspect Ratio**: Use appropriate aspect ratios for your video dimensions
6. **Public Access**: Ensure images are publicly accessible via URL
7. **Format Support**: Use supported formats (jpg, jpeg, png, webp, gif, avif)
8. **Complementary Selection**: Select images that complement your prompt description

### Parameter Optimization

1. **Dimensions**: Choose based on your content type and platform
2. **Duration**: Use 5s for quick content, 10s for detailed storytelling
3. **Seed Values**: Use specific seeds for reproducible results during development
4. **Negative Prompts**: Leverage to avoid unwanted features and artifacts
