## ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced Prompt Examples

### **1. Photorealistic Macro with Complex Optical Effects**

```typescript
const macroResult = await seedream4.generate({
  prompt: "Photorealistic macro of a cracked crystal cube suspended above an antique desk. Inside the cube: micro-rooms flickerâ€”childhood toys, rain on windows, a hallway turning into waves. 90mm macro, f/2.8, razor focus on fracture line; refracted bokeh blooms in aurora mint, lilac haze, pale amber. Dust motes sparkle like constellations. A silver key lies beneath, reflected multiple times within the cube, skewing scale. Subtle anamorphic flare. Story: each refracted facet misremembers the key in a new shape, proving memory is a prism, not a mirror.",
  style: "macro",
  aspect_ratio: "16:9",
  duration: "10s",
  resolution: "4K",
  camera_movement: "orbital"
});
```

**Key Elements:**
- Technical photography specifications (90mm macro, f/2.8)
- Complex optical effects (refraction, bokeh, anamorphic flare)
- Narrative storytelling through visual metaphor
- Scale distortion and multiple reflections
- Atmospheric color palette (aurora mint, lilac haze, pale amber)

### **2. Memory-Based Narrative Visualization**

```typescript
const memoryResult = await seedream4.generate({
  prompt: "Memory as a prism: A grandmother's kitchen dissolves into liquid light, each surface reflecting a different momentâ€”her hands kneading dough, steam rising from a copper pot, sunlight through lace curtains. The camera moves through these refracted memories, each angle revealing a new facet of the same story. Anamorphic lens flares create emotional depth, while macro details capture the texture of flour on weathered hands.",
  style: "memory-based",
  aspect_ratio: "16:9",
  duration: "15s",
  resolution: "4K",
  camera_movement: "tracking"
});
```

**Key Elements:**
- Metaphorical representation of memory
- Multiple temporal layers in single composition
- Emotional depth through visual storytelling
- Technical details (anamorphic lens flares, macro details)
- Sensory descriptions (texture, steam, sunlight)

### **3. Microscopic Optical Effects**

```typescript
const opticalResult = await seedream4.generate({
  prompt: "Microscopic view of a dewdrop on a spider's web at dawn. Inside the droplet: the entire forest is compressed and refracted, creating infinite recursive landscapes. Each reflection shows a different seasonâ€”spring buds, summer leaves, autumn colors, winter snow. The camera orbits the droplet as it catches the first light, creating prismatic rainbows that dance across the frame. Macro lens captures every surface detail of the web's silk.",
  style: "microscopic",
  aspect_ratio: "1:1",
  duration: "8s",
  resolution: "4K",
  camera_movement: "orbital"
});
```

**Key Elements:**
- Extreme scale compression (forest in dewdrop)
- Temporal representation (four seasons)
- Optical phenomena (prismatic rainbows, refraction)
- Surface detail specification (web's silk texture)
- Dynamic lighting effects (dawn light)

### **4. Atmospheric Depth and Texture**

```typescript
const atmosphericResult = await seedream4.generate({
  prompt: "Cinematic close-up of weathered hands holding a vintage pocket watch, steam rising from a cup of tea beside it. The watch face reflects multiple scenesâ€”a train station, a garden, a libraryâ€”each reflection slightly distorted by the curved glass. Warm golden hour lighting creates soft shadows across the leather-bound books in the background. Macro lens captures the patina on the brass, the steam's delicate curl, and the texture of aged paper.",
  style: "atmospheric",
  aspect_ratio: "4:5",
  duration: "12s",
  resolution: "4K",
  camera_movement: "static"
});
```

**Key Elements:**
- Multiple reflection layers with distortion
- Atmospheric elements (steam, lighting)
- Material texture specification (patina, leather, paper)
- Emotional atmosphere through lighting
- Static composition with dynamic elements
