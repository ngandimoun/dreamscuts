# ðŸš€ Complete Dynamic Analysis Example

## Overview

This document demonstrates how the DreamCut Unified Analyzer processes a **complex real-world request** into **comprehensive, actionable analysis** ready for immediate production pipeline use.

**Key Point**: This is **DYNAMIC** - the output adapts completely based on the user's specific request and assets, not a static template.

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Example Scenario

### User Request
```
"Make a cinematic 30-second cyberpunk trailer with neon rain, 
using my reference image and video, and add my voiceover."
```

### Assets Provided
1. **Reference Image** (`cyberpunk_ref.jpg`) - Moodboard for style and lighting
2. **Video Footage** (`city_drive.mp4`) - Driving through neon-lit streets  
3. **Audio Voiceover** (`voiceover.mp3`) - Trailer narration

### Complexity Level: **High**
- Multiple asset types with different roles
- Specific creative requirements (cyberpunk + neon rain)
- Precise technical constraints (30 seconds, cinematic)
- Professional quality expectations
