# ðŸŽ¬ Cinematic Effects Upgrade - Shotstack Compatible

## Overview
Upgraded the script enhancer from flat, generic effects to cinema-grade, parameterized effects that are fully compatible with Shotstack API's video rendering model.

## ðŸš€ Before vs After

### Before (Generic & Flat)
```json
"effects": ["bullet_points", "highlighting"]
```

### After (Cinematic & Professional)
```json
"effects": [
  {
    "type": "cinematic_zoom",
    "params": { 
      "direction": "in", 
      "duration": "1s", 
      "easing": "ease-in-out", 
      "scale_factor": 1.2 
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "parallax_scroll",
    "params": { 
      "layers": 3, 
      "speed_variance": 0.3, 
      "direction": "up", 
      "duration": "1.5s" 
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "bokeh_transition",
    "params": { 
      "blur_intensity": "medium", 
      "duration": "0.7s", 
      "easing": "ease-in-out" 
    }
  }
]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Shotstack Compatibility

All effects are designed to work with Shotstack's video rendering API:

### Camera Movement Effects
- **cinematic_zoom**: Scale transforms with easing
- **slow_pan**: Position transforms with linear movement
- **parallax_scroll**: Multi-layer transforms with speed variance

### Transition Effects
- **bokeh_transition**: Blur filter animations
- **split_screen**: Multiple tracks with wipe transitions
- **crossfade**: Opacity animations between scenes

### Text & Overlay Effects
- **overlay_text**: Text assets with fade-in animations
- **text_reveal**: Typewriter animations with positioning
- **logo_reveal**: Layered assets with glow effects

### Visual Enhancement Effects
- **lens_flare**: Overlay effects with positioning
- **motion_blur**: Blur filters with directional control
- **color_grade**: Color correction with style presets

### Professional Effects
- **data_highlight**: Pulse animations with accent colors
- **chart_animation**: Draw-in animations with easing
- **product_highlight**: Scale and glow combinations

## ðŸŽ¨ Creative Profile Integration

Each creative profile now has a curated set of cinematic effects:

### Finance Explainer
```json
