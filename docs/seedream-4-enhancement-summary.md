## ðŸŽ¨ Featured Prompt Examples

### **1. Your Crystal Cube Example**
```typescript
"Photorealistic macro of a cracked crystal cube suspended above an antique desk. Inside the cube: micro-rooms flickerâ€”childhood toys, rain on windows, a hallway turning into waves. 90mm macro, f/2.8, razor focus on fracture line; refracted bokeh blooms in aurora mint, lilac haze, pale amber. Dust motes sparkle like constellations. A silver key lies beneath, reflected multiple times within the cube, skewing scale. Subtle anamorphic flare. Story: each refracted facet misremembers the key in a new shape, proving memory is a prism, not a mirror."
```

**Key Elements Showcased**:
- Technical photography specifications (90mm macro, f/2.8)
- Complex optical effects (refraction, bokeh, anamorphic flare)
- Narrative storytelling through visual metaphor
- Scale distortion and multiple reflections
- Atmospheric color palette (aurora mint, lilac haze, pale amber)
- Memory and narrative visualization

### **2. Memory Visualization Example**
```typescript
"Memory as a prism: A grandmother's kitchen dissolves into liquid light, each surface reflecting a different momentâ€”her hands kneading dough, steam rising from a copper pot, sunlight through lace curtains. The camera moves through these refracted memories, each angle revealing a new facet of the same story. Anamorphic lens flares create emotional depth, while macro details capture the texture of flour on weathered hands."
```

**Key Elements Showcased**:
- Metaphorical representation of memory
- Multiple temporal layers in single composition
- Emotional depth through visual storytelling
- Technical details (anamorphic lens flares, macro details)
- Sensory descriptions (texture, steam, sunlight)

### **3. Microscopic Optical Effects**
```typescript
"Microscopic view of a dewdrop on a spider's web at dawn. Inside the droplet: the entire forest is compressed and refracted, creating infinite recursive landscapes. Each reflection shows a different seasonâ€”spring buds, summer leaves, autumn colors, winter snow. The camera orbits the droplet as it catches the first light, creating prismatic rainbows that dance across the frame. Macro lens captures every surface detail of the web's silk."
```

**Key Elements Showcased**:
- Extreme scale compression (forest in dewdrop)
- Temporal representation (four seasons)
- Optical phenomena (prismatic rainbows, refraction)
- Surface detail specification (web's silk texture)
- Dynamic lighting effects (dawn light)
