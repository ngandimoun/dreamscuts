## Prompt Engineering for Face Characters

### Best Practices

#### **Character Description**
```typescript
// Good: Detailed character description
"Professional portrait of a young adult woman with long brown hair, blue eyes, high cheekbones, defined jawline, wearing business attire, confident expression, studio lighting, high resolution, detailed, sharp focus, professional quality, 8k, masterpiece"

// Better: Include specific facial features
"Professional portrait of a young adult woman with long wavy brown hair, bright blue eyes, high cheekbones, defined jawline, subtle smile, wearing navy blue business suit, confident expression, professional studio lighting, high resolution, detailed, sharp focus, professional quality, 8k, masterpiece"
```

#### **Consistency Prompts**
```typescript
// For multiple images of the same character
const basePrompt = "Professional portrait of a young adult woman with long brown hair, blue eyes, high cheekbones, defined jawline";
const variations = [
  `${basePrompt}, wearing business attire, confident expression, studio lighting, high resolution, detailed, sharp focus, professional quality, 8k, masterpiece`,
  `${basePrompt}, wearing casual clothing, friendly smile, natural lighting, high resolution, detailed, sharp focus, professional quality, 8k, masterpiece`,
  `${basePrompt}, wearing formal dress, elegant pose, soft lighting, high resolution, detailed, sharp focus, professional quality, 8k, masterpiece`
];
```

### Character Builder Helper

  gender: 'female',
  age: 'young-adult',
  ethnicity: 'Caucasian',
  hairColor: 'brown',
  hairStyle: 'long',
  eyeColor: 'blue',
  facialFeatures: ['high cheekbones', 'defined jawline'],
  expression: 'confident',
  clothing: 'business attire',
  setting: 'studio',
  style: 'realistic',
  lighting: 'studio lighting',
  pose: 'head-on',
  additionalDetails: 'professional quality, 8k, masterpiece'
});
```

  prompt: 'Professional portrait of a young adult woman with long brown hair, blue eyes, wearing business attire, confident expression, studio lighting, high resolution, detailed, sharp focus, professional quality, 8k, masterpiece',
  imageSize: 'portrait_4_3',
  numImages: 1,
  acceleration: 'none'
});
```

### Character Design
```typescript

## Cost Management

### Pricing Structure
- **Base Cost**: $0.025 per megapixel
- **Acceleration**: 
  - None: Base price
  - Regular: +20% for faster generation
  - High: +50% for fastest generation
- **Billing**: Rounded up to nearest megapixel

### Cost Optimization
1. **Choose Appropriate Size**: Use smaller sizes for testing
2. **Optimize Acceleration**: Use 'none' unless speed is critical
3. **Batch Requests**: Process multiple characters together
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track costs and adjust settings
5. **Use Seeds**: Reproduce results without regeneration

### Cost Examples
- **Portrait 4:3 (1024x768)**: ~0.8 megapixels = $0.025
- **Square HD (1024x1024)**: ~1.0 megapixels = $0.025
- **Landscape 16:9 (1920x1080)**: ~2.1 megapixels = $0.053

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
- **Invalid API Key**: Verify your FAL_KEY environment variable
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Fal.ai's rate limits
- **Invalid Parameters**: Check parameter ranges and formats
- **Safety Checker**: Some content may be flagged as NSFW
- **Network Issues**: Implement retry logic for network failures

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong",
  "details": "Additional error details if available"
}
```

## Integration

### React Component
```tsx
import { FluxSRPOFaceCharacterDemo } from '@/components/flux-srpo-face-character/FluxSRPOFaceCharacterDemo';

export default function FaceCharacterPage() {
  return <FluxSRPOFaceCharacterDemo />;
}
```

### Next.js Page
```tsx
// app/test-flux-srpo-face-character/page.tsx
import FluxSRPOFaceCharacterDemo from '@/components/flux-srpo-face-character/FluxSRPOFaceCharacterDemo';

export default function TestFluxSRPOFaceCharacterPage() {
  return <FluxSRPOFaceCharacterDemo />;
}
```

## Best Practices

### Face Character Generation
1. **Use Detailed Prompts**: Include specific facial features and characteristics
2. **Specify Lighting**: Choose appropriate lighting for your use case
3. **Consider Style**: Select realistic, cinematic, or artistic styles
4. **Test Different Sizes**: Choose appropriate image dimensions
5. **Use Seeds**: For reproducible results and consistency

### Character Consistency
1. **Maintain Base Description**: Keep core character features consistent
2. **Vary Context Only**: Change clothing, setting, or pose, not facial features
3. **Use Similar Prompts**: Structure prompts consistently across variations
4. **Test Variations**: Generate multiple images to verify consistency
5. **Document Prompts**: Keep track of successful prompt patterns

### Quality Optimization
1. **Use High Inference Steps**: 28+ steps for best quality
2. **Optimize Guidance Scale**: 4.5 is usually optimal
3. **Enable Safety Checker**: For content filtering
4. **Choose Appropriate Format**: JPEG for photos, PNG for transparency
5. **Monitor Results**: Review generated images for quality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Poor Quality**: Increase inference steps or adjust guidance scale
2. **Inconsistent Characters**: Use more detailed prompts and maintain base descriptions
3. **High Costs**: Optimize image sizes and acceleration settings
4. **Slow Generation**: Use acceleration options or reduce image count
5. **API Errors**: Check API key and rate limits

### Debug Mode
```typescript
const result = await generateFaceCharacter(input, {
  timeout: 120000,
  retries: 2,
  fallbackAcceleration: 'regular'
});
```
