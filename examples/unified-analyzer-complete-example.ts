/**
 * HOW TO USE THIS ANALYSIS
 * 
 * This comprehensive output can drive the entire generation pipeline:
 * 
 * 1. SHOTSTACK INTEGRATION:
 *    - Use pipeline_recommendations.recommended_workflow for timeline
 *    - Apply asset_utilization_strategy for role assignments
 *    - Follow success_metrics for quality checkpoints
 * 
 * 2. REPLICATE/FAL.AI CALLS:
 *    - Use creative_options for style parameters
 *    - Apply processing_recommendations for each asset
 *    - Follow optimization_recommendations for cost control
 * 
 * 3. ELEVENLABS (if needed):
 *    - Audio analysis shows high quality, minimal processing needed
 *    - Focus on synchronization rather than enhancement
 * 
 * 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
 *    - Follow identified_challenges for risk mitigation
 *    - Use fallback_strategies if primary approaches fail
 *    - Monitor warnings_and_notes for quality control
 * 
 * 5. USER COMMUNICATION:
 *    - Use executive_summary for quick updates
 *    - Reference creative_options for decision points
 *    - Show pipeline_status for progress tracking
